1. What will be logged to the console from the below expression. explain why.

```js
let sum = 5+ 5+"5";

console.log(sum);
```

- The result will be 105. The reason behind this is that the expression is finding the sum of two intgers 5+5 which is equal to 10. Then, the third plus is used to concatenate the third 5 which is treated as a string "5".
