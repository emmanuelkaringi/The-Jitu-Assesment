- Implement a React form component called LoginForm that includes an email input and a password input. On form submission, validate the inputs and display an error message if they are empty.


- Implement a React context called ThemeContext that provides a theme (e.g., light theme or dark theme) to its child components. You can merge this implementation on the first task.
